  <h1>Research Proposal</h1>
  <img src="https://www.vippng.com/png/full/158-1582718_skyline-clipart-small-town-town-clipart-transparent-background.png">
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <p>Over the past roughly two years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed a massive increase in the utilization of online learning resources used to continue the movement of school during these times. Nowadays it is just about as common to have an online class to an in person class, however the meaning of an “online class” has begun to vary depending on the course and professor. I am interested in this shift to using online tools in an academic environment and how this has affected overall student morale and learning. I think it is imperative that in this time we note and document the kind of changes that have been temporarily implemented in our society/universities and how this is currently affecting this generation of college students. Education is, and will continue to be an ever important tool of humanity so it should be assumed that research that treats the nature and status of learning tools in relation to students is extremely important. For this research I will be collecting data from PSU students relating to how their learning morale has shifted during this pandemic.</p>

  <h3>Background/Review of the Literature</h3>
  <p>As this is a present day situation that has been unfolding for the past couple years, I have some pre-existing knowledge on this topic, especially because I have been a student during a portion of this pandemic. I think that my pre knowledge of this topic will greatly help me come up with methodology and research methods to connect with other college students. 
I found a research study about this topic from Georgia State University School of Public Health Students. The study considered the situation with online learning right now and expressed how this adaptation was made and how quickly it became a part of their routine academia. A quote from the study that stuck out to me was an observation of difficulties students have with online learning. 
<br>“What is at issue with distance learning in the COVID-19 environment is the lack of options for students to determine whether they want to take online courses or not, the lack of access to free technology hardware, software and internet services on campus due to social distancing, a lack of motivation to learn; the new course workload, adapting to unfamiliar technology for first time online student users and uncertainty about the future among others (Armstrong-Mensah et al.)” </br>
Furthermore in this article, they conducted research on a large group of students through surveys and asked a variety of questions that addressed many common concerns there are with online learning. The purpose of the study was, to quote: 
<br>“(i) identify the challenges GSU SPH students were facing with their academic work as a result of COVID-19; (ii) inform GSU SPH leadership and faculty about the challenges so they can take appropriate steps to address them; and to (iii) identify the positive aspects of the on-line transition as a result of COVID-19 (Armstrong-Mensah et al.)”</br>
This study was very interesting to me and definitely deals with the same theme as mine. I think what this research is lacking is really just relativity to the students here at PSU. Across the country many universities have been affected in very similar ways. However, I am positive that there would be differences between: region of students, field of study, etc. For these reasons I think it is important that many, if not all universities take a step in this direction and harvest data on the realities of online learning. 
	I have also found other studies that examine the effect of COVID-19 with college students from different universities. There seems to be a decent amount of already conducted research on this topic, however it is all very new information as the COVID-19 pandemic arose just a couple years ago.

<p>2) Question Study
Central phenomenon: How COVID-19 has impacted students desire to learn
Participants: PSU students 
Research Site: Portland State University
	We are mainly interested in collecting data from all Portland State University undergraduate students. This research will be conducted via survey, focus group, and on campus canvasing that will collect subjective data that will then be analyzed in multiple facets to gain a further understanding of post COVID-19 student morale. All data will be collected in their respective formats, where we will then create a database where we can further analyze data trends with percentages of students and other statistical evidence. 
	<br></br>
3) Problem or Objective
	While there is much data being collected on the various effects of COVID-19 from a medical context to environmental and social contexts, I as a student from PSU see a lot of significance within this research project. It is extremely important to track data and sentiment from COVID-19 currently so that we can better implement effective teaching methods and other facilities that will benefit our university during this pandemic and perhaps even in the future for a different pandemic. Many universities have collected similar data like this following the pandemic and I am sure PSU has collected COVID-19 related data from their students. I believe that PSU should continue in the footsteps of other universities and continue in its own collection of COVID-19 data from their students. With this data we could gain further insight into the overall sentiment of online/other impacts to learning during this pandemic, and make changes for better following the trends of our collected data.
