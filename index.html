  <h1>Research Proposal</h1>
  <img src="https://www.vippng.com/png/full/158-1582718_skyline-clipart-small-town-town-clipart-transparent-background.png">
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <p>Over the past roughly two years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed a massive increase in the utilization of online learning resources used to continue the movement of school during these times. Nowadays it is just about as common to have an online class to an in person class, however the meaning of an “online class” has begun to vary depending on the course and professor. I am interested in this shift to using online tools in an academic environment and how this has affected overall student morale and learning. I think it is imperative that in this time we note and document the kind of changes that have been temporarily implemented in our society/universities and how this is currently affecting this generation of college students. Education is, and will continue to be an ever important tool of humanity so it should be assumed that research that treats the nature and status of learning tools in relation to students is extremely important. For this research I will be collecting data from PSU students relating to how their learning morale has shifted during this pandemic.</p>
</div>

<div id="News" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Background/Review of the Literature</h3>
  <p>As this is a present day situation that has been unfolding for the past couple years, I have some pre-existing knowledge on this topic, especially because I have been a student during a portion of this pandemic. I think that my pre knowledge of this topic will greatly help me come up with methodology and research methods to connect with other college students. 
I found a research study about this topic from Georgia State University School of Public Health Students. The study considered the situation with online learning right now and expressed how this adaptation was made and how quickly it became a part of their routine academia. A quote from the study that stuck out to me was an observation of difficulties students have with online learning. 
<br>“What is at issue with distance learning in the COVID-19 environment is the lack of options for students to determine whether they want to take online courses or not, the lack of access to free technology hardware, software and internet services on campus due to social distancing, a lack of motivation to learn; the new course workload, adapting to unfamiliar technology for first time online student users and uncertainty about the future among others (Armstrong-Mensah et al.)” </br>
Furthermore in this article, they conducted research on a large group of students through surveys and asked a variety of questions that addressed many common concerns there are with online learning. The purpose of the study was, to quote: 
<br>“(i) identify the challenges GSU SPH students were facing with their academic work as a result of COVID-19; (ii) inform GSU SPH leadership and faculty about the challenges so they can take appropriate steps to address them; and to (iii) identify the positive aspects of the on-line transition as a result of COVID-19 (Armstrong-Mensah et al.)”</br>
This study was very interesting to me and definitely deals with the same theme as mine. I think what this research is lacking is really just relativity to the students here at PSU. Across the country many universities have been affected in very similar ways. However, I am positive that there would be differences between: region of students, field of study, etc. For these reasons I think it is important that many, if not all universities take a step in this direction and harvest data on the realities of online learning. 
	I have also found other studies that examine the effect of COVID-19 with college students from different universities. There seems to be a decent amount of already conducted research on this topic, however it is all very new information as the COVID-19 pandemic arose just a couple years ago.

<p>2) Question Study
Central phenomenon: How COVID-19 has impacted students desire to learn
Participants: PSU students 
Research Site: Portland State University
	We are mainly interested in collecting data from all Portland State University undergraduate students. This research will be conducted via survey, focus group, and on campus canvasing that will collect subjective data that will then be analyzed in multiple facets to gain a further understanding of post COVID-19 student morale. All data will be collected in their respective formats, where we will then create a database where we can further analyze data trends with percentages of students and other statistical evidence. 
	<br></br>
3) Problem or Objective
	While there is much data being collected on the various effects of COVID-19 from a medical context to environmental and social contexts, I as a student from PSU see a lot of significance within this research project. It is extremely important to track data and sentiment from COVID-19 currently so that we can better implement effective teaching methods and other facilities that will benefit our university during this pandemic and perhaps even in the future for a different pandemic. Many universities have collected similar data like this following the pandemic and I am sure PSU has collected COVID-19 related data from their students. I believe that PSU should continue in the footsteps of other universities and continue in its own collection of COVID-19 data from their students. With this data we could gain further insight into the overall sentiment of online/other impacts to learning during this pandemic, and make changes for better following the trends of our collected data.

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <p>How has online learning from COVID-19 affected student morale and willingness to learn at PSU?
How has online learning changed student motivation to learn?
What is the preferred method of learning during these times?
Has online learning created a more difficult school agenda?
What do these trends indicate about the difference of preferences among: gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, etc? 
These questions help solidify and define this topic to provide data. From my pre-existing knowledge of these topics, I would expect to receive a lot of mixed responses. In my experience I have seen many students love and hate online learning platforms, and I think answers will vary greatly. There are many factors that come into play while looking at a student's success in online learning. I hope that through asking multifaceted questions we would receive effective information that expresses online learning trends among PSU students. 
</p>

<div id="About" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Method and Design</h3>
  <p>Procedures/Methods:
Research would be conducted through various outreach methods. We would prepare a set of designated questions that treat the questions about online learning and offer a likert scale to answer. We would make this an online survey that anyone could access through a link. We would post said links around boards on PSU campus. We would also implement different outreach methods such as by email lists, letters, and canvassing on campus. We would also canvas students on campus and ask questions live and document said data. As well as having focus groups where we would ask set questions.
These methods would be best for our purpose because we are directly connecting with PSU students to get raw data. With these methods we would be able to successfully pull information from our target audience. We would be asking any PSU student that would desire to respond. Because this research is centralized on PSU students we would be open to hearing from any student. We would leave information anonymous but would ask about first language, age, if they live on campus, and ethnicity. This sub data would allow us to analyze trends in the preference of online learning. To be a part of this research you would have to be a full time undergraduate PSU student, no other requirements. PSU staff would be excluded from the study but things like age would not matter.
Stimuli in this research would look like a set of specific questions that would give us good data surrounding the types of feelings students have about online learning. We would ask multifaceted questions that provide in depth qualitative information. We would also work with various language departments to provide these survey questions in multiple languages. For canvassing and focus groups we would ask different questions to cultivate better responses.  Factors that would be changed in the presentation of stimulus sentences would be a change to the questions to better cultivate appropriate responses. These factors could either confirm or disconfirm my hypothesis. Qualitative research is non-linear and depending on the popular majority of overall sentiment in the theme of online learning the hypothesis will be proven or disproved. If we manipulated the factors to cater more to a response that favors the hypothesis that would allow us to confirm it. The significant differences we would need to confirm or disconfirm my hypothesis would be depending on the types of responses we get from students. If many people answered and expressed bitter feelings towards online learning, that would change the outcome of the results to confirm the hypothesis. On the other hand, if students responded in favor of online learning and expressed a lack of change to morale/motivation, or if the results were mixed those could change the outcome of the data thus impacting the hypothesis. In the design of this study, by formatting questions to ask only about information regarding this study, that would rule out potential for uninterpretable data and unnecessary data.</p>
<p>Subjects for Study:
	Because this research will be heavily centralized on the experience of PSU students, our target audience will be undergraduate full time PSU students. There are about 27,000 students at PSU so that number gives us a general idea of the population size we are working with. For collecting data, we will try to spread the word and integrate into various modes of research conduction in order to receive an authentic study sample of the entire population of PSU. We would hope to receive data from around 10 percent of the student body; however, we will collect as much data from as many subjects as possible in order to strengthen our results when we analyze the data. 
	</p>
<p>Measurement:
	On our surveys we will provide a likert scale to have subjects answer the questions. The main theme treated from this research is how the students at PSU are feeling in regards to the shift to online learning. We will ask numerous questions involving their learning preferences, what year they are in, how this has impacted them, etc. Once we have all of our collected data we will be able to draw conclusions from the data about generalized opinions of online learning due to COVID-19 at PSU. 
	</p>
<p>Data Collection Methods:
	We will be conducting research in three modes that are: Online survey, Canvas survey, and a focus group.The step by step protocol will essentially be standard for whichever format is selected by the participant. The following reflects the process within our data-collection methods. If participant decides to complete online survey they will: 
<ul>
	<li>1) Find board with survey link,</li>
<li>2) Decide they want to participate in research opportunity, </li>
<li>3) Use an online device to access survey link, </li>
<li>4) Said participant will fill out their information and survey, </li>
<li>5) Information will be sent off to us where it will be stored to analyze further.</li>
	</ul><br>
	</br>If a participant completes the survey by canvassing we will: 
<ul>
<li>1) Be on PSU campus standing with sign for people to come,</li>
<li> 2) Participant will engage and we will ask following questions, or have them fill out a written paper survey, </li>
<li>3) Data will then be stored for later analysis. </li>
</ul>
<br>We will also have a focus group protocol which involves: 
</br><ul>
<li>1) Post flyers about said focus group and get the word out by sending emails and spreading information,  </li>
<li>2) Once we have enough participants we will have a scheduled zoom meeting time,  </li>
<li>3) At zoom meeting we will hold discussions about research topics as well as collect information via survey questions, </li>
 <li>4) After the focus group, data will be collected and organized to later be analyzed.  </li>
</p>
<p>Analysis:
Results will be analyzed by converting likert scale survey questions into charts that show trends and other facets of data analyzation. Other data we collected would be compared and analyzed to show the majority of how students feel about willingness to learn. We will analyze our data by calculating averages and other percentages of the responses and comparing trends in if the consensus is that students have experienced a decrease in learning morale due to online learning and COVID-19. Because this data will be mainly counting responses from individual students' feelings about this subject, a large part of our analysis will lie in observing and comparing the data and the overall trends it shows. Analyzing this data will either prove or disprove the hypothesis. It is predicted to have a mixture of data however with a majority to a lowered sense of morale with online learning. If students responded with a majority saying that they experience no change in morale and willingness to learn via online learning, this would disprove the hypothesis. If students expressed that they did experience a loss in morale and motivation with the shift to online learning and this was a majority, this would agree and confirm the hypothesis, however there is expectation of a mixture of responses.
